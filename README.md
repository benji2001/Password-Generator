Password Generator in Python

This is a simple password generator in Python that creates random and secure passwords that meet certain criteria. The generator creates passwords with a mixture of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks. It checks if the generated password contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, at least one digit, and at least one punctuation mark. If the generated password doesn't meet these criteria, it generates a new password until a suitable one is found.


Usage

To generate a new password, run the script and it will output a password of 12 characters by default. You can specify a different length by passing a parameter to the `generate_password` function.

Security

While this password generator creates passwords that meet certain criteria for security, it's important to note that generating passwords is only one aspect of creating a secure system. It's recommended to use strong and unique passwords for each account, enable multi-factor authentication when possible, and follow other best practices for security.
